# github-user-status

Web app that checks a github user's status, analytics, profile, and more!

## Usage

The way this github status app works is:
First you input the username of a github account.
After that submit your github name of choice.
Now some of this user's details should start appearing on screen.
If inputed a non-valid github user account then it will not show any information at all.
To search a new github account status just input again a new username into the application and it should work as before.
